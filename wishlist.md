# Things that would be nice:
- client:
    - use canvas
        - still export with svg though?
            - maybe not? canvas can export to png
    - config:
        - toggle all labels on/off
- python:
    - stop changing directory
    - allow user to write the outpath
        - let them write json OR draw
    - matrix vs list
        - just _know_ which is which
    - put up on pip
    - networkx integration
        - add weights to edges if present
- BUGS:
    - figure out directed
- DOCUMENT:
    - behavior regarding note count
    - behavior with edges regarding weights
        - i.e., it will take the first edge's weight
    - parameter names
    - how it works
    - make more examples
    - how freezeNodeMovement pass-in only functions when there's nodeCoordinates
