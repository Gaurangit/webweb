# Things that would be nice:
- client:
    - migrate d3 v3 --> v5
        - use canvas
        - still export with svg though?
    - title display
    - config:
        - export
        - toggle all labels on/off
        - initial node positions
    - use User colorScheme whenever possible
        - i.e.
            - if binary
            - if scalar && fewer than # colors scalars
    - add links
    - add nodes
    - remove requirement to input node number
    - transform nodes into list alla: { 'id' : 1, 'string' : 'name', 'other_attr' : 'cheese' }
- python:
    - stop changing directory
    - allow user to write the outpath
    - matrix vs list
        - just _know_ which is which
    - put up on pip
    - networkx integration
        - add weights to edges if present
- add output directories
    - simple script to allow passing arbitrary files to the viewer
- BUGS:
    - figure out directed
- DOCUMENT:
    - behavior with edges regarding weights
        - i.e., it will take the first edge's weight
    - parameter names
    - how it works
