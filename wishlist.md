# Things that would be nice:
- migrate from d3 v3 --> v5
    - because html.canvas > svg
    - still export with svg though?
- python:
    - stop changing directory; allow user to write the outpath
- initial node positions
- toggle all labels on/off
- matrix vs list
    - just _know_ which is which
> - networkx integration
    - add weights to edges if present
- remove requirement to input node number
- add output directories
    - simple script to allow passing arbitrary files to the viewer
- add ability to title network
- BUGS:
    - figure out directed
    - document behavior with edges regarding weights
        - i.e., it will take the first edge's weight
