# Things that would be nice:
- client:
    - use canvas
        - still export with svg though?
            - maybe not? canvas can export to png
    - config:
        - toggle all labels on/off
    - be better about node/edge list loading
        - allow for dict of nodes with "id" function
    - change the way labels are represented:
        - make it so that it is:
            - display.labelTypes = { label: type }
            - network.netname.labelTypes = { label : type }
        - make nodes!
            - web.nodes = [{ 'name' : 'xyz' }]
            - web.network.netname.add_frame(adj, nodes)
    - fix display when binary and only one value
- python:
    - stop changing directory
    - allow user to write the outpath
        - let them write json OR draw
    - matrix vs list
        - just _know_ which is which
    - put up on pip
    - networkx integration
        - add weights to edges if present
- DOCUMENT:
    - BINARY
        - if you use true/false, will work
    - CATEGORICAL:
        - if you use strings, will work, otherwise, specify labeling via labels obj
    - frames
    - state directed is not supported
- examples to make:
    - categories.py
    - weights.py
- changes:
    - can't do the nice drag thing :(
